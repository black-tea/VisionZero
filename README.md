# VisionZero

This is a collection of all scripts related to the Vision Zero program in Los Angeles. 

### NewSignals

The purpose of this project was to identify candidate locations for new signals in the City of Los Angeles, based on safety warrant criteria outlined in the CA MUTCD. 

### ProtectedLeft

For intersections that were already signalized, the purpose of this project was to idenfy candidate locations for protected left-turn signals, based on safety warrant criteria outlined in the CA MUTCD.

### SafetyBenefitEstimation

Beyond the specific warrant criteria, we extended the script capability to forecast the safety benefit of other safety engineering countermeasures, such as roadway reconfigurations. 

### CenterlineCleaning

This folder includes all the scripts that were used to help clean up the street centerline and intersection file provided by the Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering.
